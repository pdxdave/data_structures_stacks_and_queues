Data Structures Stacks and Queues

### Stacks
Stacks are Last in Last Out (LILO).  Think of them like a stack of plates.  You stack plates putting one on top of another.  When you need a plate, you take the first plate on top

### Queues
Queues are First in First Out (FIFO).  Think of them as people waiting in line for a movie.  The first person in line will be the first person through the door.
